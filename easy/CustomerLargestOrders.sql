-- Question 8
-- Query the customer_number from the orders table for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders.

-- It is guaranteed that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other customer.

-- The orders table is defined as follows:

-- | Column            | Type      |
-- |-------------------|-----------|
-- | order_number (PK) | int       |
-- | customer_number   | int       |
-- | order_date        | date      |
-- | required_date     | date      |
-- | shipped_date      | date      |
-- | status            | char(15)  |
-- | comment           | char(200) |
-- Sample Input

-- | order_number | customer_number | order_date | required_date | shipped_date | status | comment |
-- |--------------|-----------------|------------|---------------|--------------|--------|---------|
-- | 1            | 1               | 2017-04-09 | 2017-04-13    | 2017-04-12   | Closed |         |
-- | 2            | 2               | 2017-04-15 | 2017-04-20    | 2017-04-18   | Closed |         |
-- | 3            | 3               | 2017-04-16 | 2017-04-25    | 2017-04-20   | Closed |         |
-- | 4            | 3               | 2017-04-18 | 2017-04-28    | 2017-04-25   | Closed |         |
-- Sample Output

-- | customer_number |
-- |-----------------|
-- | 3               |
-- Explanation

-- The customer with number '3' has two orders, 
-- which is greater than either customer '1' or '2' because each of them  only has one order. 
-- So the result is customer_number '3'.

-- count number of customer_number
-- rank the count of customer_number
-- get max of count

-- solution 1:
with sub as (
    select customer_number, rank() over(order by count(customer_number)) as rank_orders
    from orders
    group by customer_number
)
select customer_number
from sub
where rank_orders = 1

-- solution 2:
with sub as (
    select customer_number, count(customer_number) as count_cust
    from orders
),
sub_2 as (
    select s.*, rank() over(order by count_cust desc) as rank_cust
    from sub s
)
select customer_number 
from sub_2
where rank_cust = 1
